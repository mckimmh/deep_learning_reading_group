# Deep Learning Reading Group

This repository displays information about the Deep Learning Reading Group at the Mathematics Department at Imperial College London in 2023. The group will aim to learn the fundamentals of the topic (as opposed to recent advances) by going through ''Deep Learning'' by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. We'll meet on Tuesdays at 4pm in SHER-04-402.
